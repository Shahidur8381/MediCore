## Feature Walkthroughs

### 1. Queue-Based Appointment Booking (Patient)
1. Log in as **Patient**.
2. Go to **"Book Appointment"**.
3. Select a Department → Doctor → Date.
4. Click **"Continue to Payment"** → Dummy SSLCommerz modal appears.
5. Enter any card details (e.g., `4242 4242 4242 4242`, `12/25`, `123`) → Pay.
6. System auto-assigns a **Queue Number** (e.g., "You are Queue #3") for that doctor on that date.
7. Appointment is listed with the queue number, not a time slot.

> **No two patients can share the same doctor on the same date with conflicting time slots.** The queue system assigns positions sequentially.

---

### 2. Doctor: Confirm & Consult
1. Log in as **Doctor**.
2. Go to **"My Schedule"**. Appointments are grouped by date and show queue numbers.
3. **Pending** appointments show two buttons: **Confirm** and **Cancel**.
4. Click **Confirm** to accept the appointment.
5. Now a **Start Consult** button appears.
6. Click **Start Consult** → goes to the Consultation page.

---

### 3. Doctor Consultation: Prescription + Multiple Lab Tests
On the consultation page:
- **Write a Prescription** (Diagnosis, Medicines, Notes).
- **Order Lab Tests**: Select from the dropdown, optionally check "Waive my 25% commission", click **Add Test** — you can add **multiple tests**.
- All ordered tests appear in the "Ordered Tests" panel on the right.
- **Two completion options**:
  - **"Wait for Lab Results"** — marks appointment as `Waiting`, doctor can resume later. Only enabled if there are pending lab tests.
  - **"Complete Consultation"** — saves prescription and marks appointment as `Completed`.

---

### 4. Patient Pays Lab Test Fee
1. Log in as **Patient** → **Lab Results**.
2. Tests ordered by the doctor appear with **"Unpaid"** status.
3. Click **"Pay ৳[amount]"** → Dummy SSLCommerz.
4. After payment, status changes to **"Lab Processing"** (Awaiting Result).
5. Financial ledger is updated with the 25/75 split (or 0/100 if doctor waived).

---

### 5. Lab Panel: Process & Submit Report

## Financial Logic

| Transaction | Total Paid (by Patient) | Doctor Gets | Admin Gets |
|------------|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Appointment | ৳X | ৳X × 80% | ৳X × 20% |
| Lab Test (normal) | ৳X | ৳X × 25% | ৳X × 75% |
| Lab Test (waived by Dr) | ৳X × 75% (discounted) | ৳0 | ৳X × 75% (100% of total paid) |

> **Note**: All financial calculations use `Math.ceil()` to ensure that partial amounts are rounded up to the nearest whole Integer, avoiding floating point prices.
